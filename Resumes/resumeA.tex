This report covers the design, development, testing and implementation phases of the continuous integration and delivery pipelines, and the automation tasks done within Konvergence. We will also explain the steps of each phase, emphasizing the technological choices and adopted paradigms.\\

We'll start by setting up three continuous integration and delivery pipelines for different versions of the IFRS16 application, a major product based on the Shuttle. These pipelines allow the build of the IFRS16 application, the test and rapid feedback the eventual problems.\\

The second part of this internship consists in designing an automatic mechanism for running the performance tests for the Shuttle platform and reporting the results. Given the big volumes treated by Shuttle applications, the stability of response time is a very important constraint.\\

These projects required first of all a familiarization with the Shuttle solution, a unified and collaborative software dedicated to decision management in the areas of financial and operational performance and edited and maintained by Konvergence, as well as the tools used for the deployment and testing of the platform. A study of the basic concepts of continuous integration, automatic testing and continuous delivery is necessary to acquire the necessary knowledge to implement complex workflows for a tool such as the Shuttle.\\
